# Dog-Data-Wrangling-and-Analyzing
This a data wrangling and analysis exercise part of a Udacity Data Analytics course

## Introduction

This project entails the wrangling and data analysis contained in three separated datasets all with a common origin in a Twitter dog rating platform called WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. This project is an assignment from UDACITY Data Analytics course.

## Usage

Three datasets are used in this project need to be available in the same working directory:

    An Enhanced Twitter Archive twitter-archive-enhanced.csv extracted and enriched by Udacity to use in this project containing tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for over 2500+ of tweets between August 1, 2015 and August 1, 2017.

    An Image Predictions Dataset image-predictions.tsv' with images of the dogs and their respective breeds obtained through a neural network containing URL images and tweet_id.

    An Additional Twitter Dataset to be gathered from Twitter's API using the tweet_id contained in the Enhanced Archive. 
    
The code to interrogate the API and the ouput file 'tweet-json.txt' are provided in case you donÂ´t want to retrieve the data yourself.
